# Pre-downloaded backing tracks

Drop audio files here (e.g. from **TrueFire** or other sources) so you can import them into the app.

## How to use

1. **Copy your files here**  
   Put MP3, WAV, M4A, or other audio files in this folder (or in any folder on your computer).

2. **In the app**  
   Open the Backing Track panel → click **Import file(s)** → choose the files from this folder (or from TrueFire’s download location).

3. **Play**  
   Imported tracks appear under “Saved loops.” Select one and click Play.

## TrueFire

TrueFire stores downloaded backing tracks inside its own app data. You can:

- Use **Export** or **Share** in TrueFire (if available) to save tracks to a folder, then use **Import file(s)** in this app to add them.
- Or locate TrueFire’s download folder on your computer and use **Import file(s)** to select those files directly.

Files you import are stored in the app’s library (browser/IndexedDB) and stay available until you remove them.
