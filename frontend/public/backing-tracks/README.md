# Project backing tracks

Audio files in this folder are backing tracks stored in the project. They're always available and can be committed to git.

## How to use

1. **Import from the app**  
   Open the Backing Track panel → click **Import file(s)** → choose MP3, WAV, M4A, or AAC files from your computer.  
   Imported files are saved here and appear under "Project (saved to disk)" in the dropdown.

2. **Or copy files manually**  
   You can also add files directly to this folder. The app will list them when the backend is running.

3. **Play**  
   Select a track from the dropdown and click Play.

## Requirements

- The backend must be running (Realtime Service URL set in the app).
- Files are served via the backend API and stored in this folder.
